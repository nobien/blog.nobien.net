So you're going to be in town for[ Flash on Tap](http://www.flashontap.com/) and you're a fan of the beer. As I said in an earlier post, I will not be attending. But that doesn't mean I can't help out. Here's a list of places to eat and things to check out concerning Beer in Boston. Once I got going on it, it turned into a decent size, so if you leave Boston unhappy with the beer selections, it's your problem.


> [**The Publick House, Brookline** ](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-publick-house-brookline) - This is one of the best beer bars and restaurants in the area. The owners have quite a monopoly of great taste and terrific business plans for the area, as they own the next two great places.
  -- [ **Publick House Provisions, Brookline** ](http://www.yelp.com/biz/publick-house-provisions-brookline)- This is a beer store. Bring your wallet because you will spend a ton. I recommend purchasing some [Pretty Things, Jack D'Or](http://prettythingsbeertoday.com/site/) while in town.
  -- [**The Roadhouse, Brookline**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/roadhouse-bbq-brookline) - Also owned by the Publick House crew. Great beer, good food ... they have a nice patio and lots of tables. For any of these, take the Green Line to Washington Square. They're all out there.

> [**Deep Ellum, Allston**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/deep-ellum-allston) - This is one of my favorite beer bars in Boston. The staff is great and the beer is amazing. One of the few places in Boston to ever pour Captain Lawrence liquid gold. They also have a great classic cocktail list. If you care about beer, go there.

> [**The Independent, Somerville**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-independent-somerville) -  This is a little hard to get to, but worth the trip. Out in Union Square, just past Inman Square.
 
> [**Cambridge Brewing Company, Cambridge**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cambridge-brewing-company-cambridge) - CBC is one of my local favorites. They have amazing beer, and they're in my neighborhood... So I can't complain. They're located in Kendall Square, off of the red line. Good for large groups.

> **[Jacob Wirth, Boston](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jacob-wirth-restaurant-boston)** - This is right down the street from the conference. Classic German pub. I believe one of the oldest in Boston.

> [**Rock Bottom, Boston**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-bottom-restaurant-boston) - Also near the conference. It's a chain brewery, but their beer is good. I've had bad experiences with their food though.

>[** John Harvards Brew House, Cambridge**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/john-harvards-brew-house-cambridge) - Also in my neighborhood. Great beer. Can't say as much for the food. I hear it's good for pub food. It's in Harvard Square off the Red Line.

> **Boston Beer Works** ([Fenway](http://www.yelp.com/biz/boston-beer-works-boston-2), [NorthStation](http://www.yelp.com/biz/boston-beer-works-boston)) - Not necessarily a favorite, but Beer Works brews their own, and they're good beers. Both places are awesome for very large groups of people. The North Station location has pool tables. If the Sox are in town, avoid the Fenway location.

> [**Christophers, Cambridge**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/christophers-cambridge) - My wife and I go here about once every two weeks. I love the food and the beer selection. Good all around choice, right off the Red Line (Porter) and great for a group of people.

>[ **Cambridge Commons, Cambridge**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cambridge-common-cambridge) - This places has an excellent selection of Beer. Oh, and they have tater tots. It's owned by the Christophers people and located between Harvard and Porter on Mass Ave.

> [**Sunset Grille and Tap, Allston**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sunset-grill-and-tap-allston) - This place has one of the largest selections of craft beer in Boston. Take the Green Line (B) out to Harvard Street and follow Harvard towards the river... it's down on Brighton Ave. Also good for larger groups.
  -- [**Big City, Allston**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-city-allston) - Owned by the owner of Sunset (who appears in one of the latest Sam Adams commercials ... anyways.. ). This is a pool hall with a great beer selection.

> [**Green Street Grille, Cambridge**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-street-cambridge) - This place has excellent beer and great fine-dining (ish) foods. A little on the pricey side, but whatever... Everyone there is awesome and well worth the cash. It's also two blocks away from me, so let me know if you go..

> [**Red Bones, Somerville**](http://www.yelp.com/biz/redbones-somerville) - Great beer and BBQ. Out in Davis Square, right off of the train.
 
> **Bukowski's Tavern** ([Cambridge](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bukowski-tavern-cambridge) & [Boston](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bukowski-tavern-boston)) - The best thing to ever come out of Buks is Deep Ellum. The owners of Deep Ellum had enough of Bukowski's, quit, and started something wonderful. Why am I posting this? Because they have good beer and a kitschy atmosphere. Fun for a visit. Although I think their prices are too high and music too loud.
