Flash on Tap is coming up real soon (May 28th-30th). The [speaker list](http://www.flashontap.com/#/speakers/) looks amazing. But what matters more to me is the [beer](http://www.flashontap.com/#/beer/). Sadly neither Matt or I will be attending Flash on Tap, but if I was, I would be hitting up The Bruery, Stone and Lagunitas. Unfortunately, the cost of these conferences are pretty high for out-of-pocket, and it can be quite a hassle to try to get a company to pay for you. Either way... This looks to be a terrific Flash conference, and you can't go wrong with adding beer into the picture. Although watch out, [Todd](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/) is an angry drunk.

That being said, Matt and I will be volunteering at the [American Craft Beer Fest (June 19th/20th)](http://beeradvocate.com/acbf/). This is one of (if not the) largest beer fests on the East Coast and shouldn't be missed. There's also a good chance I'll be attending the [Great American Beer Fest](http://www.beertown.org/events/gabf/).
