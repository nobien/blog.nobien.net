Out of curiosity, how many Flash/Flex/Designer/Developers, whatevers, out there brew their own beer? Both Matt and I brew beer and definitely enjoy all things beer related. This question comes after watching "[The American Brew](http://www.herestobeer.com/beer_basics/history_of_beer.aspx)," a DVD that I picked up at the American Crafter Brew Fest here in Boston. 
I think the number mentioned in this movie was that over 500,000 American's brew their own beer. So I ask how much of that number is populated by our community. 

Also, should you reply to this ... let us know what you're brewing. I for one am currently fermenting an **Imperial Stout** and an **ESB**. Pretty stoked on the Stout.

Lastly, although I haven't decided if I'm going to go, I think it's awesome that [Flash on Tap](http://www.flashontap.com/fot/fot.html) popped up and that Keith and Chris (fellow Bostonians) are kicking up the Boston pride by naming a local Flash Convention after Boston's favorite crutch. There is an excellent line up of speakers, and I hope there will be a terrific turn out.
