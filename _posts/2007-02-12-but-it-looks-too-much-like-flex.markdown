First, I must digress. I have to admit, I've been really reluctant to get into Flex and MXML and all that jazz. Although, I do think Actionscript 3 is a huge improvement over the previous version. But Flex just doesn't feel like Flash to me. Maybe I'm ignorant, or maybe its because of my design schooling, or maybe its because I don't really build applications but rather consumer "experience" websites. However, the more and more Actionscript I write and the more I get into OOP concepts, the more it is starting to appeal to me. So recently I started familiarizing myself with Flex and what not just so I know what I'm missing out on. 

Now to get on with the point of my post. I've checked out a few Flex applications online and some of the functionality displayed in these apps is awesome. My only gripe is that **everything looks like Flex**! Granted, I'm a total n00b when it comes to Flex and I'm sure there are ways to skin stuff, but right now it seems like a total pain in the ass. BUT! I did do some searching around today and just happened to stumble across what seems to be the start of a really awesome website: [scalenine.com](http://www.scalenine.com/).



> ScaleNine is a collection of themes created for Flex. It also serves as a source for interface options that expand beyond Flex's default theme. Some involve graphical skinning and others are purely CSS.



So this is starting to get me a little more interested, which is a good thing, because I certainly can't make consumer sites my whole life. Now its time to dive deeper into all of this and maybe have Marc teach me a few things.
