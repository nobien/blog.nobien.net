At least that's what I'm assuming will happen when I arrive at [Flash on Tap](http://www.flashontap.com) in Boston next month. I'm pretty damn sure the organizers can't go wrong. The lineup looks fantastic, and the format is also rather intriguing. During the day there will be various smaller sessions, but then after dinner there will be one track sessions (of the assumingly "more likely to be crowded" sessions)  with beer tasting in between. This could possibly exhibit the most socializing/networking I've ever seen at a Flash conference. Oh, and did i mention there's going to be a bunch of catered food throughout?! This already sounds freaking awesome. I can't wait to go. I might even have some fellow [ROKKAN](http://www.rokkan.com)ites with me. 

You don't like beer you say? Well don't worry, the conference schedule is jam packed with brilliant people to keep you busy and interested. But who knows, maybe you'll actually find a beer that you might like! I have no idea what will be offered, but seeing as [BeerAdvocate ](http://beeradvocate.com)is a sponsor can only mean good things to come.

Additionally, Boston is a great city to visit for beer related activities. They have quite a few bars with great beer selections and food. Most notably the The Publick House & Monk's Cell in Brookline. I highly recommend that place as they have fantastic food and beer. I also just heard a rumor from [Todd Anderson](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/) that the owners recently opened another joint nearby that focuses on American beer and BBQ. Radical.

See you there??
