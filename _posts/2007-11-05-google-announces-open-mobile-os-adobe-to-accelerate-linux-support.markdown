So Google has announced their open mobile OS initiative: [Android](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/android_overview.html). The OS is based on Linux, totally open source, and will be released under the Apache v2 license. Additionally, there are already a slew of carrier, software, manufacturing, and other various "[alliance](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com)" members. And to top it all off, they'll be unveiling an SDK on November 12th. Sounds pretty promising, no?

I can't help but wonder what Adobe is thinking today. Will this help the Flash Player or AIR get on mobile phones? Will Adobe take interest at all? I sure hope so. I'm getting rather excited over the possibilities.
