Another quick update on AS3BloggerLib. I changed the package name to reflect the nobien brand. It changed from 'org.mattwright...' to 'com.nobien...'. Why you ask? First, I don't want it to be confused with the most infamous Matt Wright in the internet world. And second, I want to push the nobien name a bit more. Oh, and yes, we have a .net domain name, but there's just something weird about starting a package name with 'net', don't you think?

At any rate, I've added a new download and deprecated the old one. I've also started adding some wiki pages. Hopefully this will give all you developers out there a quick glance at the library rather than having to download it and explore the packages.

The library has only been downloaded  a couple times so far, and probably isn't really being used by anyone, but if you do happen to download it, I'm really looking for some feedback so that I can make this thing the best it can be.
