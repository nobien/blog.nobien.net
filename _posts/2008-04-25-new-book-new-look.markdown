After a year of neglect, we have finally revamped our blog. This new look will hopefully pressure us (more so, me) into posting more. 

One main reason why we haven't been updating this site as much within the past year is that we've been working on [Adobe AIR: Create-Modify-Reuse (or just Adobe AIR: CMR)](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0470182075/002-0497366-7052004?SubscriptionId=1YNZ339ZCHHAKYFSY702). I know we have posted some info about this in the past, but I we're pretty excited since it's finally coming out.

Adobe CMR was written by [Todd Anderson](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/) and the two of us (Matt & Marc). Additional support for the book included our editor, Brian Hermann and technical editor, [Ash Atkins](http://www.razorberry.com/blog/).

The book is a learn-by-example guide to AIR. It is in no way a reference manual. However, if you find that you learn better by building, but don't necessarily know where to start, this is for you. Adobe AIR CMR takes you through eleven sample applications that you can modify and call your own. All together, I believe the book came together really well and is something we are all proud of. If you so happen to pick it up, we hope that you enjoy it.
