So I've had a change of heart. Big whoop! It happens to everyone at some point in there life. Its kind of like when your girlfriend starts to really get on your nerves but then out of no where she...oh nevermind, I think you know what I mean. At any rate, I've been working on an HTML/CSS editor program for the book and I have to say that the Javascript/Actionscript integration is simply amazing! Maybe I'm getting excited over nothing, but I can't begin to tell you how awesome it is to be able to loop through stylesheet and css related objects all inline with my ActionScript. Sure, there's a few things you have to take into consideration, but it has allowed me to make this application in almost no time. I just have to brush up on my Javascript and bam! CSS editor! Needless to say, I'm stoked. Over and out.
