I just received a couple copies of the Chinese translation of [Adobe AIR -Create Modify Reuse](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-Create-Modify-Programmer/dp/0470182075/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255004549&sr=8-4). It's pretty exciting to see your book translated into other languages, even if you can't read them. 

I'd like to donate them to a High School or College. Would anyone in academia like a **Chinese **_or **Spanish **_translated copy of our [book](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-Create-Modify-Programmer/dp/0470182075/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255004549&sr=8-4)? I'd prefer to hear from people who instruct New Media or IT courses, or is involved with a school's library. 

I will only ship these to a school address. No home addresses. No student dorms and housing. Please email me at aircmr "@" nobien.net.
