So I just got the OK from [work](http://www.rokkan.com) to go to the [FITC Chicago](http://fitc.ca/event_detail.cfm?festival_id=62) event. I'm pretty excited because I'm actually quite interested in the sessions that are going to be happening at the one day event. Most particularly I'm looking forward to hearing      Samuel Agesilas ([levelofindustry.com](http://www.levelofindustry.com/) fame) speak about Orchid. I'll also be hoping to _maybe_ hear some news about his Saffron project. That of course would just be a bonus. At any rate, is anyone else going? Perhaps I'll bring a few copies of [the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470182075) to hand out if anyone would be interested.
