I had the pleasure of hanging out with [Elad](http://www.elromdesign.com/blog) [Elrom](http://www.twitter.com/EladElrom) last night. He's one of the organizers of the upcoming [Flash and the City](http://www.flashandthecity.com/) conference here in NYC. I highly recommend attending this conference for the following reasons:

**1. Its in F*ckin' New York City!**
I know NYC isn't for everyone but there's everything you could imagine here. On top of learning and getting inspired about Flash you'll have everything NYC has to offer at your finger tips. The organizers of the conference know this and have created what they call the "City Track". They've organized a few "field trips" throughout the city that you can tag along with. Just think of all the cool stuff you'll be able to check out, eat, and do while you're here!

**2. Its at the 3-Legged Dog Art & Technology Center**
This place is just plain cool. Its entirely artist-run and have been supporting the arts in NYC since the center was built in 2006 just three blocks south of the WTC site. Personally, it feels good to be supporting such an organization.

**3. The ridiculously good list of attending speakers**
ZOMG! Srsly u guys! There hasn't been a large Flash conference in NYC...since...I don't know...2004? And that one pretty much sucked. But just look at the [list of speakers](http://blog.flashandthecity.com/speakers/)! If you don't recognize the names, just trust me on this. They're are some really sharp people speaking about some great developments in the industry.

**4. The Price is Right**
Tickets right now are $299 (but lets just be real and say $300). In comparison to other conferences, this is CHEAP, especially for NYC standards. Â And if you keep your ear in the community (Twitter, blogs, etc), you might even be able to find a coupon code!

I'd say these are my main reasons for anyone to attend the conference right now. I'm sure I'll come up with more and if I do, I'll update this post. Naturally, I plan on attending seeing as I live here and I hope to see you along with my other friends and colleagues here as well! It's gonna be a blast.
