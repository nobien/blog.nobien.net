So a few years ago I used to have to write PHP for a few projects I worked on at my old job. I wasn't very good at it and it was all procedural. Often it included some generated code from Dreamweaver, yuck. For the past year and a half I haven't written a single line of server side code. Being able to say that is sort of nice in some respect, but at the same time I wish I was able to write object oriented PHP to supplement some personal projects. Whats a Flash guy to do? Perhaps learn to use [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org)! From the CakePHP website:



> Cake is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like ActiveRecord, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.



My coworker recently used CakePHP for the entire backend of a Flash project which we worked on together. It handles the data, the form handling and even the remoting. The remoting is handled with a version of AMFPHP. Their community is very Flash friendly and even have a flash remoting example on the website. My coworker also lurks their IRC channel for help from time to time and he said its been very helpful.
