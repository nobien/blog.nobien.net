I'm going to start tooling around with game development in AS3. Oh trouble is, I'm not sure where to start. Does anyone have any nice sites/blog entries/tutorials on game design and architecture that they'd like to point me to? It'd also be nice to have a decent list of things to check out when someone, like myself, decides to get into game development, or needs help figuring something out.
