As of late, it seems that AIR has been gaining some popularity. Popularity that is certainly well deserved. Honestly, I had my doubts at first, but the deeper I get into [the book we are working on](http://www.amazon.com/AIR-Instant-Results-Marc-Luchner/dp/0470182075/) I am finding it to be a really fantastic platform for application development. One particular application that has me extremely excited is an application entitled [Saffron ](http://www.levelofindustry.com/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=676235&categoryId=114963)that is being developed by [Samuel Agesilas Pastel](http://www.levelofindustry.com). Its pretty apparent from what he has shown on his blog that the application looks to be one of the best practical uses of the Flex and AIR platforms. I can't help but notice just how beautiful the application looks as well. The interface seems to be delicately crafted and executed to perfection. Of course I'll have a better idea if I ever get to use the application, but needless to say, this application really gets me excited about the future of AIR.
