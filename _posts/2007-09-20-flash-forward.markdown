We'd like to say 'thank you' to everyone who attended our presentation this afternoon.  We really appreciate the support.  And if you were wondering, the slides will be posted tomorrow.  I'm too tired to do anything right now.

We're interested in seeing what everyone thought of our presentation.  Also, what would you like to see offered if we were to revamp and represent this topic again.

Thank you again.  Also, if you see either Matt and myself walking around, please feel free to say hello.
