I totally missed this, but Adobe, in cooperation with O'Reilly, launched the [Flex 2 Cookbook Beta](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/communityengine/index.cfm?event=homepage&productId=2) site.  I believe they put this up around the New Year ... so it's not all that old.

The point of this site is to post solutions to problems that you may have encountered with Flex 2.  If you're familiar with O'Reilly's existing Cookbook series... Adobe is essentially looking for people to mimic the structure of that series.  If the editors like your solutions, they will add them to the printed edition of the Flex 2 Cookbook, by Joey Lott (and apparently you).

After a couple months of having the site live... it's pretty disappointing ... there are only Flex related questions but no real 'solutions.'  Hopefully it picks up and straightens itself out.
