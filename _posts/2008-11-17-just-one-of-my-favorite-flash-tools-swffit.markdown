I just have to mention this really quickly. When working on [tridentgum.com](http://www.tridentgum.com) I was introduced to, what I thought might be, a little known JavaScript tool for Flash proejcts. We had to give the site a minimum height and width in the browser but still go 100% if the screen is larger than the minimum size. Something I've done before but just not so easily. At any rate, the lead developer at the other agency we were working with discovered [swffit](http://swffit.millermedeiros.com/). It makes doing this sort of thing ridiculously easy. In most of my cases, I just need a minimum width and height, which is usually the width and height of my FLA's. Otherwise, the site can stretch to the size of the browser.

I recommend [swffit ](http://swffit.millermedeiros.com/)to everyone!
