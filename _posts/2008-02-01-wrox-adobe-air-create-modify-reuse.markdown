I haven't been up on posting lately, mainly because Matt Wright, Todd Anderson and I have been in a lock down trying to get the our book, Adobe AIR Create-Modify-Reuse, ready for publishing. As of last night, we reached our goal. The book is written and is placed on the back-burner for a while.

Apparently it now goes to Wiley (publisher) for in-house reviews, style changes, etc.  We'll see the book again before it's finished. As it is, Adobe AIR/Flex 3 hasn't gone gold yet, and we'll probably have to update our code one final time when that happens. We will most likely have to change applicationDirectory back to applicationResourceDirectory or someting new like nativeApplicationDirectory.

Either way, thank you Matt, Todd and Brian (our editor) for your help with our book. Everyone should stay tuned as to when it will actually be released.
