So...way back in the day, Julian Dolce from Fuel Industries used to have this totally awesome extension for the Flash IDE that would let you change the properties more than one library item at a time. So today, I'm on my new computer at work, and realize I could really, really use this extension.Â  I search the Google for it over and over with all sorts of search terms, but can't find it anywhere. Weird.

So I realized I have it on my old computer. I go to my old computer and try to open a path to a shared folder on my new computer so I can copy it over. And as the computer is trying to access my new computer, KABOOOM! Blue Screen of Death. Except this particular BSOD said something about a memory dump at the end. Awesome. So I restart...nothing. Power down and power up again. Nothing. Awesome! I'm guessing the MB is dead as the BIOS doesn't even load up. Wonderful.

I don't have the time to pull out the hard drive and try and salvage the files, so my question to any and all of you out there that use the Flash IDE, do you have this extension? I'm desperate! I'm not sure what I will do in return if you have this extension, but I'll try and think of something.
