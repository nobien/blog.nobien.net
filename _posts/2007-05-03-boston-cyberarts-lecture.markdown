Everyone who showed for tonights CyberArts lecture, thank you.

Hopefully it wasn't too boring or too fast.  There was a lot of material to cover and a pretty broad topic.  Either way, I hope you all enjoyed learning about Flex tonight (Joey's lecture included).

As promised, here are the links I was talking about at the end of the presentation.

Please email me (mleuchner [ a t ]  schmatic com) if you have any questions.

As promised, here is the project files for the music player (a work in progress) :
