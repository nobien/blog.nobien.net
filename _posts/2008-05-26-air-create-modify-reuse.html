Back on the 25th of April, I posted a little something about us (Matt & me ... and [Toddly Anderson](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/)) releasing a certain book entitled [Adobe AIR, Create-Modify-Reuse](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-Create-Modify-Programmer/dp/0470182075/002-0497366-7052004?SubscriptionId=1YNZ339ZCHHAKYFSY702), published by Wiley & Sons.

Well, at that time, MXNA was down, so only a few regular viewers saw it. So I figured I'd just throw it out there again that our book came out. It's a book featuring eleven applications that you can use "out of the box" and hopefully use to create your own rendition using Adobe Flex 3 and AIR. If you do create your own app based on ours, or found the book useful in guiding your own creation, we encourage you to tell us about it.

Also, you should pick up the [Flex 3 Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529856/ref=s9subs_c2_img1-2871_p?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=17QQMBQ720TS6T3W2QPM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=278240301&pf_rd_i=507846) by friends Josh Noble and Toddly Anderson (again). Another book (that will be awesome) is [Adobe AIR in Action](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-Action-Joseph-Lott/dp/1933988487/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211845320&sr=1-6) and was written by my old co-workers Joey Lott, Katheryn Rotondo, Sam Ahn and Ash Atkins (also the tech-editor of our book).

So now that you're about $80 in the hole, I'll let you be.
