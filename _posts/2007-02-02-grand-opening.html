We are very pleased to announce that today marks the official grand opening of blog.nobien.net! Hooray! *applause* Wow, exciting, right? Well maybe not to you, but to Marc and I its a pretty cool thing. Nobien.net is going to be our development playground, and this blog will serve as a journal for our findings, our complaints, and perhaps a few other rants and raves. Whats in the works you might say? Well, we have a few ideas (mostly Marc's) that we will perhaps pursue and one word comes to mind. ACTIONSCRIPT! Yes, the language that hardcore CS guys like to make fun of and in some cases even worse, like the time I was once told by a .NET developer (not surprising) that Actionscript is not a "real" language. But what does a .NET developer know about Flash? Seriously.
