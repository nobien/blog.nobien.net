Where would a tech 'blog' be without tech related material?  So for my first post, I'd like to list a couple things that I'm planning on learning before friday of next week.  As it is, this is a completely unattainable goal since I just got my hand on a Nintendo Wii.  But never the less ... this is it.



	
  * [ASUnit ](http://www.asunit.org/)- I'd like to learn more about unit testing.  The project I'm working on at work requires us to use unit testing ... something I know very little about.  We're using ASUnit since the project is in AS3.

	
  * [Adobe Labs AS3 Libraries](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ActionScript_3:resources:apis:libraries) -  I had no clue these existed. I never have time to explore this stuff .. hopefully this week, I'll find time.

	
  * Adobe Macromedia Flash 9 CS3 Blaze Beta 4 - whatever it's called today, I finally got my hands on the beta and I'm planning on tinkering with it.


I think that's enough for now.  Somewhere in there is "begin working on fun projects" and "finish reviewing chapters for Joey's flex book."   So much to do ... I'm going to go play Elebits.
