It's been a while since I've written a post on here .. mostly because I just changed jobs.  I was at Schematic in Boston before Monday.  I'm at [Almighty ](http://www.almightyboston.com)(also in Boston) now.  Almighty seems like an awesome fit.  Everyone there is pretty cool and they do excellent work.  I _could_ go into more detail about everything like why Almighty is better than Schematic, etc ... but that's for another discussion.

What is really bothering me is the fact that I'm on a Mac now.  No, I don't hate Macs.  I actually love OSX, and when I sold my Mac three years ago, I really missed OSX.  Given that... my gripe is with the Flash community and the lack of a good ActionScript editor.

In the past two days, I've tried TextMate, SE|PY, and FDT for Eclipse.  FDT seems like the best answer for what I'm looking to do, except I can't get code-hinting to work.  TextMate is better than SE|PY in that it doesn't crash. However, SE|PY has code-hinting.

Now here's where the real issue comes from, I've been developing in FlexBuilder or FlashDevelop for the past year (FlashDevelop even longer).  FlexBuilder is awesome for AS3.  Code and class lookups, etc... and FlashDevelop has many of the same features.  However, Builder doesn't like AS2 (am I wrong?) and FlashDevelop runs on .NET so kiss that idea good-bye.  

Does anyone know of any good editors for OSX that are perfect for ActionScript 2/OOP editing, or should I keep trying to get FDT to work?
