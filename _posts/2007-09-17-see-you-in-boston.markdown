Hey everyone. Just a little reminder that Marc and myself will be speaking at [FlashForward](http://www.flashforwardconference.com) in Boston on this Thursday, September 20th. Our talk is entitled [_Designers vs. Developers: How to Avoid Fights on the Playground_](http://flashforwardconference.com/sessions?sid=812). We'll be hanging out the entire conference too, so if you see us, please feel free to say hello and share some of your stories about working with "the other side". We'd love to hear them and might perhaps be able to give some advice. Travel safely, everyone!
