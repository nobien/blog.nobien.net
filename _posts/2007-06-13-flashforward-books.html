We've been wickedly busy over the past couple of months.  Outside of rocking our day jobs ( at Schematic & Rokkan ), we've been co-authoring a book on Adobe AIR with [Todd Anderson](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/) ( of Schematic ).

On top of this, we're presenting at [FlashForward](http://www.flashforwardconference.com/), Boston in September.  Our presentation is entitled, "Designers vs. Developers: How to Avoid Fights on the Playground."  As the name implies, it's going to be focusing on how Designers and Developers can work together better by understanding some helpful tips and tricks of each of the disciplines.  Matt & I are originally from a design education, but as it turns out, we've both weaseled our ways into programming/development roles in our respective companies.  As such, we constantly rack our brains on how the two different sides of the office can work together better, or how designers could learn the basics of programming easier.  

We'll hopefully talk more about these things in the upcoming months, as we get closer to launch dates.
