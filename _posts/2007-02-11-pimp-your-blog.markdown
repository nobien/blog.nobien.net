Sunday's are awesome because you can sit around and do nothing thats productive and not feel guilty about it. So after watching Arsenal come back from a goal down against Wigan, I did a lot of snooping around for WordPress stuff. At first I was looking around for useful plugins, and I realized that I should setup [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) for this blog. There's a handy plugin to easily set that up for WordPress located over at [Richard Boakes Blog](http://boakes.org/analytics). I also stumbled across the widgets plugin that allows you to add all sorts of stuff to your side bar. There are some handy dandy widgets available too. Everything widget related can be found at [widgets.wordpress.com](http://widgets.wordpress.com/). I advise all you WordPressers check it out.
