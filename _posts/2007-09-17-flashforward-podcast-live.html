I love blogging about blog posts by bloggers.  Blog.

Our interview is posted up on the FlashForward Conference blog. About two months ago, Christoph at FlashForward interviewed Matt and me over the phone. At the time, I was at Schematic.  I'm no longer with Schematic, but the material still sticks since it's all about what we're going to be chatting up on Thursday.  Hopefully this will entice you to stop into our presentation.
