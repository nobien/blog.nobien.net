I think I'd be putting it lightly if I said that [eyeo festival](http://www.eyeofestival.com) was inspiring. It was easily the best gathering of talented minds that I've been to over the years. I'd only be echoing the words of nearly every attendee if I was to go into any detail about what made the event so great, so I'll spare your time. The biggest thing in my mind is that eyeo must be an indicator of where our minds should be headed.

You can so easily forget about what artists, designers, and developers are doing outside the stereotypical agency world of microsites, Facebook apps, Twitter mashups, and the like. Much of this work isn't rooted in the web, and as a developer I am more inspired to look beyond the laptop and mobile screen. I know I have the skills and know-how, I just need to get my mind out the rut its been in and into the area that the speakers and attendees of eyeo have carved out.
