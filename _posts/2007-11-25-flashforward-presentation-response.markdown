FlashForward has come and gone and at last, we've received our audience response. Over all, I'd like to thank everyone again for attending our presentation, and we're stoked about the feedback.

Our presentation was definitely based on common sense. It's definitely an odd topic to try to approach in that respect. Our original "pitch" to Lynda was to offer a "primer" session for Designers who want to get into object orientated programming with CS3/AS3.  Ala, we wanted to help designers start to understand the development side of things so they can co-mingle better.  However, when we talked to the people at Lynda, after we were accepted, we noticed that their interpretation of our pitch was a bit different than our intentions (not to mention Peter Elst basically covered that kind of content).

However, it wasn't a bad interpretation at all. We feel as if most people do not talk about the problems faced in the office and we also believe there are some issues between Designers, Developers, Copywriters, Production Managers and the sort.  Especially given that we have this technology that changes every year. It's the sort of thing that we believe needs to be constantly talked about, otherwise we just fall into our patterns and continue to look at things the same way or just get plain lazy.

Needless to say, our session wasn't for everyone. In fact, we received a few harsh responses to the content and approach. However, for the most part, we got a lot of great feedback, especially while we we're at the conference. I think a lot of people were expecting us to show specific examples of how to improve the technical workflow of a project, but we knew there were already sessions concerning that kind of stuff so we avoided it. We really wanted our message to feel more human than, say, technical.

With this said, we had a great time at FlashForward and we are thankful to have the opportunity.  Of all of the 'geeky' communities out there, the Flash community is definitely one of the more creative and supportive.

Thank you everyone,
~marc & matt

ps: sorry for the delayed response.
