We finally got around to creating a smaller version of our presentation [Designers vs. Developers ... yadda yadda yadda].  The original slides were like sixteen-billion megawatts big.  This is a bit smaller.

Sorry it took up a while to do this ... We're just exhausted from FlashForward and from the german beer fest that was today.  Matt's still in Boston, we're just chillin out today, playing SKATE. for the 360.  Awesome game.  Although we just found a huge glitch.  HA!

Well .. enjoy the weekend.  A big thanks goes to those who attended our presentation ... Those who didn't get no thanks at all!  Jerks!  heh..
