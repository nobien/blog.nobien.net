Assuming Boston doesn't get rocked by a tropical storm on Sunday, I'll be walking in the _MSPCA / Angell Walk for Animals_. I'm walking with the [BeerAdvocate team](http://www.mspca.org/site/TR/WalkforAnimals/General?pg=team&fr_id=1130&team_id=4420). If you're also walking in this event, please say hello. If you'd like to sponsor me to the tune of,[ any donations are welcome and appreciated](http://www.mspca.org/site/TR/WalkforAnimals/General?px=1477841&pg=personal&fr_id=1130&et=y9o8OFxAVLIsHcntshGNMg..&s_tafId=3351).
