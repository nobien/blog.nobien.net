Ah bummer! It seems Flash on Tap has been postponed until May. According to the [Flash on Tap Eventbrite](http://flashontap.eventbrite.com/) posting, the new dates are May 28th to the 30th.

This is actually a terrific idea. How many Flash conferences are we up to in the fall now? I think the number is at 5 or 6 right? That's really about 4 or 5 too many. There aren't too many Flash conferences in the spring, and none in New England. Boston is beautiful in May, so I'm expecting everyone to mark their calendars now and start drinking some great beers in preparation for Flash on Tap.

You can start by attending [The Return of the Belgium Beer Fest!](http://beeradvocate.com/fests/bbf) (also here in Boston)  I'll be attending the _Night of the Funk_, Friday the 26th. Hopefully Todd Anderson will be joining me (*nudge nudge*).
