Just a quick update. I've updated [AS3BloggerLib ](http://code.google.com/p/as3bloggerlib/)with proper documentation, an SWC file, and added the first download. The project feels a bit more official now that these are up there. On top of adding this stuff I also did a bit of necessary encapsulation to clean the code up a bit. I'm sure more could be done to optimize the code, such as getting rid of the dependencies, but I'm happy with it for now. I will hopefully be providing some example files to download soon as well. Who will be the first to download?? Does anyone even care about an AS3 blogger library? Ha!
