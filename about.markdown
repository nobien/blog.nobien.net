Nobien is the journal of two crazed designer/developers, Matt Wright and Marc Leuchner. Matt resides in New York City and spends his days working a [Local Projects](http://www.localprojects.com) as a Creative Technologist. His personal site, [matt.nobien.net](http://matt.nobien.net), is where you can find most of his professional work. Marc, on the other hand, lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts and works as a freelance developer.

We work on an assortment of projects together with which we will continually post entries about our findings... whatever they might be. We are both addicted to computers, craft beer, bicycles, and video games. So if you're imagining two complete dorks, then your assumptions would not be far from the truth.
